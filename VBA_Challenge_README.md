# stock-analysis 
## Overview of the project  
**Analyzing stock performance for the years 2017 and 2018**  
##  Results  
**In 2017 all stocks had a positive return except for the TERP stock however in 2018 all stocks had negative returns except for ENPH and RUN which both had gains over 80 percent**

### Coding Difference  
**Using the refactored code doubled the speed of the processing time**

## Summary  
**The advantages to using refactored code is very useful to making code more efficient and easy to understand. If you have a code that works but runs slowly it can be useful to go over it and see where you can find inefficiences and refactor it to make it run quicker. It can also be useful to add comments to your code so you and other developers can understand what the written code is expected to do. In our case refactoring the code to index and loop through the tickers made our code run twice as fast. However there are cases if a code is not written well or not commented on so you might not know what every line of the code is expected to do it would probably be better to write a new code from scratch because you never know when you will cause breaks in the data**
